## My approach

I created a react app with ```create-react-app``` and create an account and instances on [pusher website](https://dash.pusher.com/chatkit/)


## Instructions

Prerequisites
node installed

- to run the web app

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/GiadaSimonetti/chat-app
$ cd chat-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Your browser should open on localhost:3000, if it doesn't go directly to localhost:3000.
